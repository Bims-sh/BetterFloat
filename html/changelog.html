            <li><b>FEATURE:</b> Show listing age → Show the listing age in the listing card. The two available options determine the position of the text. This setting is per default turned off to prevent cluttering in standard use cases.</li>
            <li><b>BUG-FIXING:</b> Hopefully any isses with case-sensitive OS are fixed now by reverting any capitalization in file names. The original issue is explained below. </li>

            <li>Since version 1.1.0 case-sensitive OS (e.g. Ubuntu, Android) did occasionally print errors due to the changed capitalization of file names. Non-case-sensitive OS (e.g. Windows) have not been influenced by this at all. Please send a report to our Discord channel for further debugging if this is the case for your system.</li>

            <li><b>FEATURE:</b> Sticker Prices → A new tag above the applied stickers now displays a calculated sticker price percentage. This SP% is depicted by the ratio of the item price difference to the total buff price (ask) of all stickers. This feature can be disabled in the popup (default: on).</li>
            <li><b>POPUP:</b> Completely reworked the logic behind the popup. It now also features a 'changelog' tab displaying the latest changes.</li>
            <li><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The extension is now able to detect and make use of the CSFloat API requests already sent by the website. This will allow many new possibilities in the future.</li>
            <li><b>TECH-STACK:</b> Building and deploying the extension is now done using webpack. This allows for a much cleaner codebase and easier development. Please refer to the new README for more information.</li>
